Changelog:

25.09.2017:
- modified "enclosure/4mm thick aluminium/z_achse.DXF" for less post processing.

26.03.2017:
- #secondDICEupdate -> several updates at multiple different places. Biggest part: watercooling drivers and hotend.
   o modified enclosure-parts:
      ~ bodenplatte.DXF: added 2 bores to match cohesion3d-mini and several other bores for more features.
      ~ luefterhalter.DXF: redesigned the cutouts for more space inside the electronic compartment
      ~ traegerplatte_B.DXF: added an additional cutout to make the z-axis motor changeable without 
        tearing the whole DICE appart. (idea of Andre Reichert, Thanks!)
      ~ front_DICE.DXF: replaced a frontpart to one with DICE-logo
      ~ z_achse.DXF: removed the pillar in the middle to get more space inside the electronic compartment

   o added firmware and config for the board "cohesion3d-mini" at "firmware/cohesion3d-mini"
      ~ the reason for adding this board to the DICE is a very high failure rate of the AZSMZ-mini 
        and zero to none support from the creator of the AZSMZ-board. The Cohesion3d-Mini does only 
        support 4 stepper drivers but has more FETs for fans and stuff and should be of a higher
        quality. It also has better connectors (easier to install wires) and 24V and/or 5V outputs 
        that remove the need for the tiny stepdown-converters. The creator Ray Kholodovsky is an active 
        dev with a support-community on g+ and reacts quickly to nearly any question. 

   o added watercooling for the DICE. 
      ~ With this, the stepper drivers and the hotend are watercooled. This reduces the overall soundlevel,
        makes a much better cooling of the heatbreak, enables to mount 2 radial blower fans for more
        print-cooling and it does look cool, too ;)
         - changed backside: additional cutout for the radiator and repositioned the other bores. The 20mm bore 
           is now "closed" and can opened if needed.
         - changed right sidecover: It has a big cutout on the bottom to make room for the big heatsink of the 
           stepper drivers. I suggest using corrosion-resistant material such as stainless steel.
         - The heatsink for the stepperdrivers is put on the inside of the sidecover and a matching acrylic sheet
           on the outside. The acrylic part has 2 holes with G1/4" tap to mount hose-connectors like they are used
           at PC-watercooling systems.
         - added a watercooled printhead. The printhead consists of 3 parts. The actual heatsink is made of an 
           acrylic cover and a matching cooling block. Then the mount for the heatbreak gets scewed to the 
           cooling block and is designed in a very simple rectangular block. This way, each on is able to easily 
           adapt other mounts for different heatbreaks. Just the heatsink on any flat surface to cool it.
         - The watercooled printhead is mounted with 4 screws to the x-carriage with a solid 5mm thick aluminium 
           plate. Loosening these 4 screws frees the printhead for maintenance.
         - Watercooling the printhead allows for a much smaller design. This way, there is now room for a second 
           partcooling fan. Additionally, there are new covers for the fans with an integrated fanshrout and cable-mount.
         - On top of the DICE, a pump and reservoir needs to be installed. I highly recommend the alphacooling DC-LT
           pump with matching reservoir for ~50€. The pump-housing has matching mounting points to the DICE. You can
           easily mount the pump with vibration dampers to reduce noice even further.
         - The acrylic transparent covers allow for tinted water to match the color of your printed parts.

02.02.2017:
